# DKTC Classification
### ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
- Objective: This project aims to develop a model that classifies threatening conversations (threats, extortion, workplace bullying, and other types of harassment) and general conversations in Korean. By training an NLU (Natural Language Understanding)-based model, we seek to analyze text data effectively and automatically determine whether a conversation is threatening.

### ðŸ“Š Dataset Composition
*`Data`* [tunib-ai/DKTC](https://github.com/tunib-ai/DKTC): TUNiB's Self-Produced Dataset to Participate in the Voice Recognition Track of the 4th AI Grand Challenge 2021. 

- The training dataset consists of approximately 1,000 samples per class for four categories: threats, extortion, workplace bullying, and other harassment.
- The test dataset consists of approximately 100 samples per class for five categories: threats, extortion, workplace bullying, other harassment, and general conversation.
  

| Dataset | Classes | Samples |  
|--------|--------|--------|
| Train | Threats, Extortion, Workplace Bullying, Other Harassment | around 4,000 |  
| Test | Threats, Extortion, Workplace Bullying, Other Harassment | around 500 |   
| Additional Data	| General Conversation (Synthetic Data, AI-hub Dataset) | (+)samples |

*`Evaluation`*: Measure by the f1 score between the results classified by the model and the correct answer.
